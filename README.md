## ✨ Core Features

### 🔍 Store Locator & Real-Time Stock
*   **Geo-Search**: Find stores within a specific radius using browser geolocation.
*   **Shelf-Level Accuracy**: View exactly where an item is (Aisle/Shelf) and its current stock status.
*   **Live Updates**: Inventory changes sync instantly via Socket.io broadcast.

### 💬 AI-Powered Negotiation Room
*   **Live Bargaining**: Initiate a negotiation session for any enabled product.
*   **Intelligent Counter-Offers**: Rule-based pricing engine that responds based on stock levels, expiry dates, and bulk tiers.
*   **Expiration Logic**: Sessions are time-limited (TTL) to encourage immediate conversion.

### 📊 Retailer Command Center
*   **Inventory Manager**: Direct sync with POS/ERP systems via secured API keys.
*   **Negotiation Analytics**: Track acceptance rates and average discounts to optimize pricing strategies.
*   **Product Lifecycle**: Manage listings, toggle negotiation flags, and set bulk discount tiers.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

OmniRetail follows a strict **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern on the backend and a component-driven architecture on the frontend.

```text
backend/
├── models/       # MongoDB Schemas (User, Product, Store, Inventory, Negotiation)
├── controllers/  # Thin Logic Handlers
├── routes/       # API Versioning (v1)
├── services/     # Heavy Business Logic (Pricing Engine, Geo-Search)
└── middleware/   # Security (JWT, API Key, Rate Limiter)

frontend/
├── api/          # Axios Interceptors & Endpoint Definitions
├── components/   # Atomic UI System
├── store/        # Zustand State Management (Auth, Cart)
└── pages/        # Route-level Views (Home, Search, Room, Dashboard)
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Reliability

- **Dual-Auth System**: JWT for consumer sessions and SHA-256 hashed API keys for Retailer integrations (POS/ERP).
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-backed protection against brute force and DDoS attacks.
- **Data Integrity**: NoSQL injection prevention and strict schema validation using Joi.
- **Performance**: <200ms response time for cached inventory lookups.

---

## 📅 Roadmap (14-Week Plan)

1.  **Phases 1-2**: Foundation & Inventory Engine (Auth, Scaffolding, Redis Sync).
2.  **Phases 3-4**: Pricing Engine & Frontend Core (Negotiation Logic, Vite Setup).
3.  **Phases 5-6**: Feature Implementation (Live Negotiation Room, Store Locator).
4.  **Phase 7**: Quality Assurance & Deployment (Cypress, Load Testing).
